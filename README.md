### Open to opportunities

I am primarily looking to start a PhD in Computer Science, with a focus on systems, security, or cryptography.

I am also open to:
- Research assistant or internship roles in security, privacy, systems, or related fields  
- Software engineering, Linux development roles that involve low-level development, tools, or developer experience
